## Create Sales Charts and Dashboards

As a part of the guided project from Coursera, this project aimed to create charts for the analysis of sales data. Pivot tables were created based on a number of parameters and charts were built to visualize the same. The charts were combined to build the dashboard.

Based on the dataset, pivot tables and charts were created to analyse the following:

-   Sales by Month
-   Sales by Salesperson
-   Items sold by Category
-   Sales profit by City
-   Sales by Product Type
